/**
 ** @brief A toy example for a usage of the #embed directive.
 **
 ** We just embed the source of this program into the executable and
 ** print it.
 **
 ** If the #embed directive is entirely supported, the preprocessor
 ** should do macro expansion of `__FILE__`. If the directory of the
 ** source file is in the include path for embed.c, the source should
 ** just be included like that.
 **
 ** If the directive is not supported you could try to compile this
 ** anyhow by using https://sentido-labs.com/en/library/cedro/. Cedro
 ** does not allow to do macro expansion for the argument of the
 ** directive, so we have to give this explicitly.
 **
 ** For the example itself to output properly, the source and
 ** execution encoding should not be too different.
